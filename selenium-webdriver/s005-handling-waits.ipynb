    "Most web apps are using AJAX techniques. When a page is loaded by the browser, the elements within that page may load at different time intervals. This makes locating elements difficult, if an element is not yet present in the DOM, a locate function will raise an **`ElementNotVisibleException`**. Using **waits**, we can solve this issue and acheive synchronization. Waiting provides some slack between actions performed - mostly locating an element or any other operation with the element.\n",
